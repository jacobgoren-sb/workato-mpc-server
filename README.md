Use the List tags (GET /api/tags) endpoint to retrieve the handles of the tags you plan to apply or remove.

#Sample request
This request adds the Accounting tag with the handle tag-ANgdXgTF-bANz3H to both a connection and a recipe in Workato.

üöÄ Getting Started
2. Installation
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Build the Server
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Adding to Cursor
This project is designed to be used as an MCP server in Cursor. Here's how to set it up:

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to Cursor Settings > Features > MCP
3. Click + Add New MCP Server
4. Fill out the form:
   - Name: Workato MCP Server
   - Type: stdio
   - Command: node /path/to/your/project/dist/server.js
   - Environment Variables:
     - Click "Add Environment Variable"
     - Name: WORKATO_API_TOKEN
     - Value: your_token_here

üìò Pro Tip: Use the full path to your project's built server.js file.

Alternative Configuration:
You can also configure the MCP server using a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workato-tools": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/project/dist/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "WORKATO_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Using with Claude Desktop:
If you're using Claude Desktop instead of Cursor, you can configure the MCP server by editing the Claude desktop configuration:

1. Open or create the configuration file:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   # On Windows
   %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   # On Linux
   ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. Add your MCP server configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcp_servers": {
       "workato-tools": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/your/project/dist/server.js"],
         "env": {
           "WORKATO_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect

This method allows you to:
- Version control your MCP configuration
- Include environment variables directly in the config
- Share the same configuration across team members (excluding sensitive values)
- Automatically load the server when opening the project in Cursor
